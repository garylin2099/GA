#' Single Crossover
#'
#' \code{crossover} accomplishes the process that parents crossover with a single split point in their chromosomes. This function returns a vector of 2*C representing the genes of two children.
#'
#' @param parents a 2 by C matrix of booleans, with each row representing a parent chromosome
